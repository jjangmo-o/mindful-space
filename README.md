## 🧠 What I Learned

This project was built to master the fundamentals of React development, including:
* **Component Architecture:** Breaking down the UI into reusable pieces (`Header`, `MoodBooster`, `TipCard`).
* **Hooks:** Managing state with `useState` and handling side effects (API calls) with `useEffect`.
* **Data Flow:** Passing props down to children and lifting state up (using callback functions) to manage the list of tips.
* **API Integration:** Using `async/await` to fetch and display data from a public API.
